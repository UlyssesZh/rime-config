# rime-config

My personal configuration for [RIME](https://rime.im).
Can be used for both Weasel and ibus-rime.

## Installation

Install the packages listed in `packages.conf` using
[plum](https://github.com/rime/plum).
Download `*.custom.yaml` to the user configuration directory of RIME
(`%AppData%\Rime` for Weasel, `~/.config/ibus/rime` for ibus-rime).
